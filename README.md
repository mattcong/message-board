# Message Board

Web app that lets users sign in with native or Google authentication and post text and images, built with React, CSS and Firebase 9. To pass authentication data between components I opted for the Context API over a larger state management system like Redux due to the size of the app, and used Hooks to fetch data from Firestore and manage the components' local state.
